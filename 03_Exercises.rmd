# Conceptual

1. Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4 correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.

    |  | Coefficient | Std. error | t-statistic | p-value |
    |:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
    | Intercept | 2.939 | 0.3119 | 9.42 | < 0.0001|
    | TV | 0.046 | 0.0014 | 32.81 | < 0.0001 |
    | radio | 0.189 | 0.0086 | 21.89 | < 0.0001|
    | newspaper | −0.001 | 0.0059 | −0.18 | 0.8599 |
    
    ```
    The null hypothesis here is that product sales do not depend on the advertising budgets for TV, radio or
    newspaper.  In other words,
    
    1. The TV advertising budget does not impact product sales.
    2. The radio advertising budget does not impact product sales.
    3. The newspaper advertising budget does not impact product sales.
    
    Looking at the p-values in the table, this is not completely true.  As the p-values for TV and radio 
    advertising are highly significant, we reject the null hypotheses that they don't have an impact on sales.
    However, we accept the null hypothesis for newspaper advertising as the p-value here is not significant.
    
    1. If the TV advertising budget was increased by $1000 while keeping the radio and newspaper budgets
       unchanged, an additional 46 product units will be sold.
    2. If the radio budget was increased by $1000 while keeping the TV and newspaper budgets unchanged, an 
       additional 189 units will be sold.
    3. Finally, if the newspaper budget was increased by $1000 while keeping the TV and radio budgets unchanged,
       product sales will decrease by 1 unit.

2. Carefully explain the differences between the KNN classifier and KNN regression methods.


    ```
    KNN uses a non-parametric way to predict the value of the output for a given observation.  It uses the 
    nearest K neighbors to the target to determine the result.  While the KNN classifier provides a 
    qualitative ouput, KNN regression delivers a quantitative response.
    
    In the case of the KNN classifier, the output is the class to which a majority of the K Nearest Neighbors 
    to the target belong.
    
    In the case of the KNN regression method, the result is the average of the output linked to the K Nearest 
    Neighbors of the target.

3. Suppose we have a data set with five predictors, $x_1$ = GPA, $x_2$ = IQ, $x_3$ = Gender (1 for Female and 0 for Male), $x_4$ = Interaction between GPA and IQ, and $x_5$ = Interaction between GPA and Gender. The response is starting salary after graduation (in thousands of dollars). Suppose we use least squares to fit the model, and get $\hat\beta_0$ = 50, $\hat\beta_1$ = 20, $\hat\beta_2$ = 0.07, $\hat\beta_3$ = 35, $\hat\beta_4$ = 0.01, $\hat\beta_5$ = −10.

    (a) Which answer is correct, and why?
    
        i. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females.
        ii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, females earn more on average than males.
        iii. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on average than females provided that the GPA is high enough.
        iv. For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, females earn more on average than males provided that the GPA is high enough.
        
            ```
            Salary = 50 + 20 * GPA + 0.07 * IQ + 35 * 1 + 0.01 * GPA:IQ - 10 * GPA * 1 (for Females)
                   = 85 + 10 * GPA + 0.07 * IQ + 0.01 * GPA:IQ
                   
            Salary = 50 + 20 * GPA + 0.07 * IQ + 35 * 0 + 0.01 * GPA:IQ - 10 * GPA * 0 (for Males)
                   = 50 + 20 * GPA + 0.07 * IQ + 0.01 * GPA:IQ
                   
            iii. Based on the formulas shown above, for a fixed value of IQ and GPA, males earn more on 
                 average than females provided that the GPA is high enough.

            ```

    (b) Predict the salary of a female with IQ of 110 and a GPA of 4.0.
    
        ```
        Salary = 85 + 10 * 4 + 0.07 * 110 + 0.01 * 4.0 * 110
               = 137.1 (or $137,100)
               
        ```
    
    (c) True or false: Since the coefficient for the GPA/IQ interaction term is very small, there is very little evidence of an interaction effect. Justify your answer.
    
        ```
        False. The p-value of the regression coefficient needs to be examined to determine if the interaction
        term is statstically significant or not.
