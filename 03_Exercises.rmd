# Conceptual

1. Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4 correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.

    |  | Coefficient | Std. error | t-statistic | p-value |
    |:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
    | Intercept | 2.939 | 0.3119 | 9.42 | < 0.0001|
    | TV | 0.046 | 0.0014 | 32.81 | < 0.0001 |
    | radio | 0.189 | 0.0086 | 21.89 | < 0.0001|
    | newspaper | −0.001 | 0.0059 | −0.18 | 0.8599 |
    
    ```
    The null hypothesis here is that product sales do not depend on the advertising budgets for TV, radio or
    newspaper.  In other words,
    
    1. The TV advertising budget does not impact product sales.
    2. The radio advertising budget does not impact product sales.
    3. The newspaper advertising budget does not impact product sales.
    
    Looking at the p-values in the table, this is not completely true.  As the p-values for TV and radio 
    advertising are highly significant, we reject the null hypotheses that they don't have an impact on sales.
    However, we accept the null hypothesis for newspaper advertising as the p-value here is not significant.
    
    1. If the TV advertising budget was increased by $1000 while keeping the radio and newspaper budgets
       unchanged, an additional 46 product units will be sold.
    2. If the radio budget was increased by $1000 while keeping the TV and newspaper budgets unchanged, an 
       additional 189 units will be sold.
    3. Finally, if the newspaper budget was increased by $1000 while keeping the TV and radio budgets unchanged,
       product sales will decrease by 1 unit.

2. Carefully explain the differences between the KNN classifier and KNN regression methods.

| Explanation | KNN Classifier | KNN Regression |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Math  | $\mathop {max}\limits_j \Pr (Y = j|X = {X_0}) = \frac{1}{K}\sum\limits_{i \in {N_0}} {I({y_i} = j)}$ | $\hat f({x_0}) = \frac{1}{K}\sum\limits_{i \in {N_0}} {{y_i}}$ |
| Math Explanation | By using indicator function, KNN Classifier statistically analyzes classes of neighborhood points and picks up the class with largest proportion where the probability of certain class to test data is maximized among all factors. | KNN Regression calculates the average of responses of neighborhood points and treats that average as the expectation of regression model. |
| Usage | Qualitative (categorical) data | Quantitative data |
